I'm Brian, my specializations include data engineering, python development, and data science. Check out my pinned repositories for some of my favorite work, or feel free to thumb through the whole catalog to see what I'm currently working on. I love all things related to data and I'm especially interested in the intersection of technology and civic applications.
